## System design is the process of planning, structuring and defining the architecture of Software System.

### Tips and Tricks to solve System Design Problem
    When you are given a System Design Problem, you should approach it in a planned manner.
    Initially, the Problem may look huge, and one can easily get confused about how to start solving it.
    And moreover, there is no fixed solution while you are designing a system.
    There is more than one way to reach the Solution.

### Approaching a Design Problem
1. Breaking Down the Problem
2. Communicating your Ideas
3. Assumptions that make sense

### Functional Requirements
what the system should do
### Non-Functional Requirements
how a system should operate


### Examples
Functional requirements: login authentication, data input/output, transaction processing.
Non-functional requirements: system scalability, security, response time, reliability, maintainability.

### SOLID Principles
S - Single Responsibility Principle (A class should have only one reason to change)
O - Open Closed Principle (Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification) which means you should be able to extend a class behavior, without modifying it.
L - Liskov Substitution Principle (Derived or child classes must be substitutable for their base or parent classes)
I - Interface Segregation Principle (do not force any client to implement an interface which is irrelevant to them)
D - Dependency Inversion Principle (High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions) Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

### DRY Principle
"Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) is a software development principle that encourages developers to avoid duplicating code in a system.

Approaches to Resolving Duplication by DRY:

  Create Functions or Methods: Identify repeated logic and encapsulate it in functions or methods that can be called from multiple locations.
  Use Classes and Inheritance: For more complex scenarios, use classes and inheritance to create reusable components that share common functionality.
  Extract Constants or Configurations: If certain constants or configurations are repeated, centralize them to a single source to avoid redundancy.
  Modularization: Break down the code into modular components, each responsible for a specific task. This promotes reusability and modularity.

### KISS Principle
"Keep It Simple, Stupid" (some variations use "Keep It Short and Simple" or "Keep It Super Simple"), is a design principle that suggests simplicity should be a key goal.

### YAGNI Principle
"YAGNI" stands for "You Aren't Gonna Need It". It is a principle in software development that suggests developers should only implement features that are necessary for the current requirements and not add any additional functionality that might be needed in the future.

### GRASP Design Principles in OOAD
Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD), General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns (GRASP) play a crucial role in designing effective and maintainable software systems. GRASP offers a set of guidelines to aid developers in assigning responsibilities to classes and objects in a way that promotes low coupling, high cohesion, and overall robustness.

### Unified Modeling Language (UML)
Structural UML Diagrams
Behavioral UML Diagrams

### Level Design or LD
1. High-Level Design (HLD): Focuses on the overall architecture of the system. It addresses questions such as which frameworks to use, what databases are suitable, how to integrate different components, and how the system will function at a broader level.

2. Low-Level Design (LLD): Once the high-level structure is in place, LLD takes over by focusing on specific components, modules, and interactions. It provides detailed design diagrams (like UML diagrams) and breaks down how each component should behave, how it will interact with others, and what algorithms and data structures will be used.

#### Roadmap to Low Level Design (LLD)
STEP 1: Object-oriented Principles
STEP 2: Process of analyzing & design
STEP 3: Design Patterns
STEP 4: UML Diagram
STEP 5: SOLID Principles
